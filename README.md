# Go Board Game with Solana Integration

A blockchain-based implementation of the Go board game where players use their Solana wallet to make moves. Each move costs SOL, creating an incentivized gaming experience.
0.00125 has the working principle I am aiming for, it is used per move for each piece. 
I can also make it as 0.00125 SOL (0.22 cents). I can take a look at the necessary places and arrangements again.
I predicted that the player who wins the game will receive 75% of the money she/he invested and 33.33% of the total fee paid by the opposing opponent per tile.
